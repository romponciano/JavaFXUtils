# Transfer Window
Class created to implement a transfer window between two lists. This class has a list (right side) with all the possibilities and a list (left side) where the options desired by the user are sent through the buttons.<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> For the class to work properly, the R type defined at user creation must be of type String or have the toString() method overrided to display the desired attribute as the label of the list items. For more examples, check the ![ModelExample.java] class
