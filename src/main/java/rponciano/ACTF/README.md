# Auto Complete Text Field
 Class created to look up user suggestions when entering text into a TextField. These suggestions are based on a list that must be passed in the constructor, in addition to the maximum number of suggestions that will be displayed.

To work, just instantiate with the constructor passing the parameters: List <String> containing the suggestions and int which will be the maximum number of suggestions to be displayed at a time.
